**_5.1-5.2 Notes/Activities_**

**5.1 Video Notes: Beneficial and Harmful Effects**
* Computing innovations can be used in harmful ways
* The World Wide Web was originally intended only for exchange of information within the scientific community
* Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
* Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful
effects of these new uses
* It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used

**5.2 Notes**
* Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
* The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic
characteristics
* The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals- The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence,
both globally and locally
* The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments 

**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:**
Beneficial:
* We can learn more information easily, distribute information easily, and would spend less time looking for things when they have been provided to us. 
Disadvantageous:
* Can destroy mental healths, become distracting because of endless scrolling, can spread false information 

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**
* Dopamine is unquestionably genuine. It has been scientifically demonstrated that it is not a parent
conspiracy. While we aren't aware of it, we are aware of it, and it gives us a heightened sensation of euphoria that is artificial. It's difficult to ignore, and it makes us more attached to our electronics, worsening our mental health. It's like a never-ending circle. 

**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**
* Someone is empowered by the use of any gadget (s). They now have duty and authority, and they may choose to utilize
it to cause damage or to promote good. When cyberbullying and other forms of harassment occur, we frequently observe wrondoing. We have an enormous amount of power through these tiny devices that goes unnoticed and is a huge disadvantage to both rural and underprivileged areas that do not have access or the financial means to gain access, and is misused by people who want to take advantage of others or use these devices to do terrible things.

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**
* We may frequently assist others by sharing our equipment or even funding goods that someone we care about does not have access to. 

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment?Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**
* There are several predefined regulations that make it impossible to allocate devices fairly, and hence not everyone is empowered. Many pupils at DNHS are unable to obtain their own device and are required to utilize a chromebook given by the school every day. This can be found all over the world, particularly in underdeveloped and rural areas, as well as a strong adherence to such rules. 


**5.3: Notes**
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the dat caused by the innovation
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development


**5.4: Notes**
* WIdespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
* Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing


**1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**
* We can collaborate on an idea for a computer science problem, which draws ideas from various people 
**2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**
* Using peoples opinions from various background we can use feedback from those who are not in computer science. 

**5.5 Notes**
* Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization
* Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use
* Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property
* Open source: Programs are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
* Open access: Online research output free of any and all restriction on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
* The development of algorithms that include bias
* The existence of computing devices that collect and analyze data by continuously monitoring activities
* Intellectual Property (IP): a work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights
* Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
* Plagiarism: Presenting material as your own
* Creative Commons provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
* It clearly tells others what they can and can not do with your IP

**5.6 Notes**
* Personally identifiable information (PII) is information about an individual that identifies, links, relates, or describes them
* Search engines can record and maintain a history of searches made by users
* Websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have viewed their pages
* Devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user’s location
* Technology enables that collection, use, and exploitation of information about, by, and for individuals, groups, and institutions
* Search engines can use search history to suggest websites or for targeted marketing
* Disparate personal data, such as geolocation, cookies, and browsing history, can be aggregated to create knowledge about an individual
* PII and other information place online can be used to enhance a user’s online experiences
* PII stored online can be used to simplify making online purchases
* Commercial and government curation of information may be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored
* Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact. For example, an email message may be forwarded, tweets can be retweeted, and social media posts can be viewed by potential employers
* PII can be used to stalk or steal the identity of a person or to aid in the planning of other criminal acts
* Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Examples of authentication measures include strong passwords and multifactor authentication
* Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces  of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know) possession (something they have), and ingerence (something they are)
* Multi Factor authentication requires at least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access
* Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data.
* Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection
* A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer
* Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation
1. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
* We picked the MIT because we want credit for our work but also want our ideas to spread. 
2. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
* About us pages have PII or private information 
3. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
* I think PII should be kept private because its your private information. I dont expose my private information because I dont want to be stalked. 
4. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
* Good password = complicated. Bad password = easy to figure out. Double factor authentication. 
5. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
* Symmetric encryption is where one key is used to encrypt and decrypt while asymmetric encription is where there are 2 keys, where one is public and one is private to encrypt and decrypt. 
6. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
* I havent deployed so I wouldnt know
7. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
* One scheme that I know of is where they tell you that you have won an amazon giftcard and to enter your private information. Another technique is to email as a company to tell you to enter your bank information.
